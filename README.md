Safemoon 2 is programmed to reward holders while increasing in both liquidity and value.
5% fee = redistributed to all existing holders
5% fee is split 50/50 half of which is sold by the contract into BNB, while the other half of the Safemoon2 tokens are paired automatically with the previously mentioned BNB and added as a liquidity pair on Pancake Swap.
